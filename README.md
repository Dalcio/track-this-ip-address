## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Stiches React](https://stitches.dev/) - For styles
- [Leaflet ](https://leafletjs.com/) - JavaScript library for interactive maps
- [React Leaflet ](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) - React components for Leaflet maps

### What I learned

- I learn **Dynamic Imports** with next js. That helped me module asynchronously and dynamically into a potentially non-module environment

### Continued development

- I pretend to continue with this project adding support for emails to.

### Useful resources

- [Create an Asset Tracker with Next.js and React Leaflet](https://dev.to/paigen11/create-an-asset-tracker-map-with-nextjs-and-react-leaflet-42d2) - This helped me setting React Leaflet with next js.
